# README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project, we implemented an React component to check password strength. I started by following tutorial like

- [Build a Password Strength Meter in React](https://upmostly.com/tutorials/build-a-password-strength-meter-react/) 
- [How To Build A Progress Bar With React](https://medium.com/@ItsMeDannyZ/how-to-build-a-progress-bar-with-react-8c5e79731d1f)

Then I used this as a tool to learn other skills such as test, CSS, etc. My experiments can be found in branches.
